# Windows7

Windows7 is what it sounds like, a collection of themes to mimic the look of Windows 7.

The installer is based of Chicago95, a theme to mimic Windows 95/98.

In this repo there is a gtk, icon, sound, cursor, and Plymouth theme.

Run installer.py in terminal with, './installer.py' in the theme directory.
